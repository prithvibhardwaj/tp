GymOps is a **desktop application for gym managers** to manage trainers and their clients. It is optimised for users who prefer a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still offering the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

---

## Introduction

### Who this guide is for

This guide is written for **gym managers and administrators** who want a fast, keyboard-driven way to manage their gym's roster. GymOps is designed for users comfortable with typing commands and working with indexed lists.

**We assume you:**
- Can open and use a terminal or command prompt
- Are comfortable typing commands with parameters
- Have Java 17 or above installed, or are able to install it
- Have basic familiarity with indexed lists (e.g. "the 2nd item in a list")

### How to use this guide

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer.

   **Mac users:** Install the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the project's release page.

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for GymOps.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` into the folder containing the `.jar` file, and run:

   ```
   java -jar YOUR_FILE_NAME.jar
   ```

   The GymOps window will appear within a few seconds, pre-loaded with sample data.

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   The window is split into two panels: **Trainers** (left) and **Clients** (right). Each panel shows a scrollable list of cards. Enter commands in the command box at the bottom and press **Enter** to execute them.

1. Try the following commands to get started:

   | Step | Command | What it does |
   |------|---------|-------------|
   | 1 | `list-trainers` | View all trainers |
   | 2 | `add-trainer n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com` | Add a new trainer |
   | 3 | `list-trainers` | Confirm the trainer was added |
   | 4 | `add-client n/Alice Lim p/81234567 t/1 [v/2028-09-09]` | Assign a client to trainer #1 |
   | 5 | `find-clients Alice` | Search for the client you just added |
   | 6 | `delete-client 1` | Delete the 1st client in the current list |
   | 7 | `clear` | Delete all data |
   | 8 | `exit` | Exit the app |

1. Refer to [Features](#features) for the full details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you supply. e.g. in `add-trainer n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual name: `add-trainer n/John Doe`.
- Items in square brackets are optional. e.g. `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `find alice` or `find alice bob`.
- Parameters can be in any order. e.g. `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` are both valid.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that take no parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.
- An `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the **currently displayed list**, not the full unfiltered list.
- GymOps displays **two lists**: **Trainers** (left) and **Clients** (right). Trainer-related indexes refer to the trainer list; client-related indexes refer to the client list.
- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying commands that span multiple lines, as spaces around line breaks may be lost.

</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Opens the **Help Window**.

The Help Window contains:
- a link to the online User Guide (with a button to copy the URL), and
- a quick command summary.

If the Help Window is already open, running `help` will focus the existing window.

Format: `help`

---

### Adding a client: `add-client`

Adds a new client and assigns them to an existing trainer.

Format: `add-client n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER t/TRAINER_INDEX [v/VALIDITY]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** If the trainer list is filtered (e.g. after a `find-trainers` command), `TRAINER_INDEX` refers to the filtered results. Run `list-trainers` first to assign by the full list.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** Run `list-trainers` to confirm the correct trainer index before adding a client.</div>

---

### Clearing all data: `clear`

Deletes all trainers and clients from GymOps.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** This action is irreversible. All data will be permanently deleted.</div>

After clearing, GymOps will immediately save the empty data set to disk.

![clear](images/clear.png)

---

### Exiting GymOps: `exit`

Exits the application.

GymOps saves automatically, so you do not need to run any additional command before exiting.

Format: `exit`

---

### Saving data

GymOps saves data automatically after every command that modifies it. No manual saving is needed.

---

### Editing the data file

Data is saved as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/GymOps.json`. Advanced users may edit this file directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** If the file format becomes invalid, GymOps will discard all data and start fresh on the next run. Back up the file before editing it. Certain edits may also cause GymOps to behave unexpectedly if values fall outside acceptable ranges.</div>

---

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon._

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

Install GymOps on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with your existing data file from `[JAR file location]/data/GymOps.json`.

---

## Known issues

1. **Multiple screens:** If you move the app to a secondary screen and later use only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. Fix: delete `preferences.json` before restarting the app.
2. **Minimised Help Window:** Running `help` again while the Help Window is minimised will not open a new window. Fix: manually restore the minimised window.
