This guide is written for **gym managers and administrators** who want a fast, keyboard-driven way to manage their gym's roster. GymOps is designed for users comfortable with typing commands and working with indexed lists.

**We assume you:**
- Can open and use a terminal or command prompt
- Are comfortable typing commands with parameters
- Have Java 17 or above installed, or are able to install it
- Have basic familiarity with indexed lists (e.g. "the 2nd item in a list")

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer.

   **Mac users:** Install the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the [project's release page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for GymOps.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` into the folder containing the `.jar` file, and run:

   ```
   java -jar YOUR_FILE_NAME.jar
   ```

   If double-clicking the `.jar` does not launch GymOps on your system, use the terminal method above.

   The GymOps window will appear within a few seconds, pre-loaded with sample data.

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   The window is split into two panels: **Trainers** (left) and **Clients** (right). Each panel shows a scrollable list of cards. Enter commands in the command box at the bottom and press **Enter** to execute them.

1. Try the following commands to get started:

   | Step | Command | What it does |
   |------|---------|-------------|
   | 1 | `list-trainers` | View all trainers |
   | 2 | `add-trainer n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com` | Add a new trainer |
   | 3 | `list-trainers` | Confirm the trainer was added |
   | 4 | `add-client n/Alice Lim p/81234567 t/1 v/2028-09-09` | Assign a client to trainer #1 |
   | 5 | `find-clients Alice` | Search for the client you just added |
   | 6 | `delete-client 1` | Delete the 1st client in the current list |
   | 7 | `clear` | Delete all data |
   | 8 | `exit` | Exit the app |

1. Refer to [Features](#features) for the full details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you supply. e.g. in `add-trainer n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual name: `add-trainer n/John Doe`.
- Items in square brackets are optional. e.g. `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `find alice` or `find alice bob`.
- Parameters can be in any order. e.g. `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` are both valid.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that take no parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.
- An `INDEX` refers to the number shown in the **currently displayed list**, not the full unfiltered list.
- GymOps displays **two lists**: **Trainers** (left) and **Clients** (right). Trainer-related indexes refer to the trainer list; client-related indexes refer to the client list.
- If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying commands that span multiple lines, as spaces around line breaks may be lost.

</div>

### General

#### Viewing help: `help`

Opens the **Help Window**.

The Help Window contains:
- a link to the online User Guide (with a button to copy the URL), and
- a quick command summary.

If the Help Window is already open, running `help` will focus the existing window.

Format: `help`

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

**Expected outcome:** The Help Window opens or comes to the front, displaying a link to the User Guide and a command summary.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows all trainers and all clients.

This command resets both lists to show all entries by:
- clearing any active `find` filters, and
- clearing any trainer selection made via the GUI (i.e. if you clicked a trainer to filter clients).

Format: `list`

**Expected outcome:** Both the trainers and clients lists are refreshed to show all entries, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Finding persons: `find`

Finds trainers and clients whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` matches `Hans`.
* The order of keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`.
* Partial words are matched. e.g. `Han` matches `Hans`.
* Each keyword must be alphanumeric. e.g. `Bob123` is valid; `Bob@` is not.
* Results include persons matching **at least one** keyword (OR search).
* Run `list` to return to the full list after searching.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** Use `find-trainers` or `find-clients` to search within a specific list.</div>

Examples:
* `find John` — returns `john`, `John Doe`, `Johnny`
* `find alex david` — returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`, `Alexander`

![find](images/find.png)

**Expected outcome:** Both lists are filtered to show only persons whose names contain the given keywords. A message showing the number of persons listed is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes a trainer or client using a typed prefix to specify the list.

Format: `delete t/TRAINER_INDEX` or `delete c/CLIENT_INDEX`

* `t/TRAINER_INDEX` refers to the index in the **trainer list**.
* `c/CLIENT_INDEX` refers to the index in the **client list**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** A trainer cannot be deleted if they still have active clients. Remove their clients first using `delete-client` or `delete c/...`.</div>

Examples:
* `delete t/2` — deletes the 2nd trainer.
* `delete c/1` — deletes the 1st client.

**Expected outcome:** The specified person is permanently removed from the application, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Clearing all data: `clear`

Deletes all trainers and clients from GymOps.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** This action is irreversible. All data will be permanently deleted.</div>

After clearing, GymOps will immediately save the empty data set to disk.

**Expected outcome:** All trainers and clients are removed from the application, the UI panels are cleared, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Exporting data: `export`

Exports the current GymOps data to a JSON file at the specified location.

Format: `export FILE_PATH`

* `FILE_PATH` can be an absolute path (e.g., `C:/data/export.json` on Windows or `/Users/name/export.json` on macOS/Linux) or a relative path (e.g., `data/export.json` or `export.json`).
* If a relative path is provided, it is resolved relative to the folder where GymOps is executed.
* The file must have a `.json` extension, and the parent directory must exist.

Examples:
* `export data/my_export.json` — exports the current data to a file named `my_export.json` inside the `data` folder.

**Expected outcome:** The current data is successfully exported to the specified file, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Importing data: `import`

Imports GymOps data from a specified JSON file, replacing the current application data.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

* `FILE_PATH` works exactly the same as in the `export` command (both absolute and relative paths are supported).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** This action overwrites your existing data. Unsaved changes to the current session will be lost, and any data existing in the specified file will take their place.</div>

Examples:
* `import data/my_export.json` — imports the data from `my_export.json` into the application.

**Expected outcome:** The application's data is entirely replaced by the contents of the imported file. The UI refreshes to show the new data, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Exiting GymOps: `exit`

Exits the application.

GymOps saves automatically, so you do not need to run any additional command before exiting.

Format: `exit`

**Expected outcome:** The application window safely closes and the program terminates.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Saving data

GymOps saves data automatically after every command that modifies it. No manual saving is needed.

---

#### Editing the data file

Data is saved as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/GymOps.json`. Advanced users may edit this file directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** If the file format becomes invalid, GymOps will discard all data and start fresh on the next run. Back up the file before editing it. Certain edits may also cause GymOps to behave unexpectedly if values fall outside acceptable ranges.</div>

---

Format: `list-clients [TRAINER_INDEX]`

* If `TRAINER_INDEX` is omitted, shows all clients and clears any active trainer filter.
* If `TRAINER_INDEX` is provided, shows only clients assigned to the trainer at that index in the **current trainer list**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** After filtering clients by trainer (via the GUI or by using an index), run `list-clients` without an index to return to the full client list.</div>

Examples:
* `list-clients` — shows all clients.
* `list-clients 1` — shows only clients assigned to the 1st trainer in the current list.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

Install GymOps on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with your existing data file from `[JAR file location]/data/GymOps.json`.

---

## Known Issues

1. **Multiple screens:** If you move the app to a secondary screen and later use only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. Fix: delete `preferences.json` (found in the same folder as the `.jar` file) before restarting the app.
2. **Minimised Help Window:** Running `help` again while the Help Window is minimised will not open a new window. Fix: manually restore the minimised window.
3. **Double-clicking the JAR:** On some systems, double-clicking the `.jar` may not start the app. Fix: run using `java -jar YOUR_FILE_NAME.jar` from a terminal.
4. **Write-protected folders:** If GymOps is placed in a write-protected folder, it may fail to save changes. Fix: move the `.jar` to a writable folder (e.g., your user directory) and run it from there.
5. **macOS fullscreen dialogs:** macOS users running secondary dialogs (e.g., Help Window) in fullscreen may encounter unexpected window behaviour. Fix: exit fullscreen for the main app window before opening dialogs.
