GymOps is a **desktop application for gym managers** to manage trainers and their clients. It is optimised for users who prefer working via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still offering the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

---

## Introduction

### Who this guide is for

This guide is written for **gym managers and administrators** who want a fast, keyboard-driven way to manage their gym's roster. GymOps streamlines the daily administrative burden of running a gym by making it incredibly fast to track trainer substitutions, assign clients, and monitor progress using dedicated **Health Tracking** features (like logging daily calorie intake and setting workout goals) without ever taking your hands off the keyboard.

**We assume you:**
- Can open and use a terminal or command prompt
- Are comfortable typing commands with parameters
- Have Java 17 or above installed, or are able to install it
- Have basic familiarity with indexed lists (e.g. "the 2nd item in a list")

### How to use this guide

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have **Java 17 or above** installed on your computer.

   **Mac users:** Install the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

   **Windows users:** Install the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html).

   **Linux users:** Install the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from the [project's release page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T17-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for GymOps.

1. Open a terminal, `cd` into the folder containing the `.jar` file, and run:


   ```
   java -jar GymOps.jar
   ```

   If double-clicking the `.jar` does not launch GymOps on your system, use the terminal method above.

   The GymOps window will appear within a few seconds, pre-loaded with sample data.

   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

   The window is split into two panels: **Trainers** (left) and **Clients** (right). Each panel shows a scrollable list of cards. Enter commands in the command box at the bottom and press **Enter** to execute them.

1. Try the following commands to get started:

   | Step | Command | What it does |
   |------|---------|-------------|
   | 1 | `list-t` | View all trainers |
   | 2 | `add-t n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johndoe@example.com` | Add a new trainer |
   | 3 | `list-t` | Confirm the trainer was added |
   | 4 | `add-c n/Alice Lim p/81234567 t/1 v/2028-09-09` | Assign a client to trainer #1 |
   | 5 | `find-c Alice` | Search for the client you just added |
   | 6 | `delete c/1` | Delete the 1st client in the current list |
   | 7 | `clear` | Delete all data |
   | 8 | `exit` | Exit the app |

1. Refer to [Features](#features) and the [Command Format](#command-format) for the full details.

## Features

<div id="command-format" markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**

- **Placeholders**: Words in `UPPER_CASE` are parameters you supply. e.g. in `add-t n/NAME`, replace `NAME` with the actual name.
- **Optional fields**: Items in square brackets are optional. e.g. `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` can be used as `find alice bob`.
- **Order flexibility**: Parameters can be in any order. e.g. `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER` and `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` are both valid.
- **Extra data ignored**: Extraneous parameters for commands that take no parameters (like `help` or `list`) will be safely ignored.
- **Index lists**: An `INDEX` always refers to the number shown in the **currently displayed list**, not the full unfiltered list.
- **Dual layout**: GymOps dynamically displays **two lists**: **Trainers** (left) and **Clients** (right). Trainer-related indexes predictably refer to the trainer list, and client indexes to the client list.
- **PDF notice**: If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying commands that span multiple lines, as spaces might be lost.

</div>

### General

#### Viewing help: `help`

Opens the **Help Window**.

The Help Window contains:
- a link to the online User Guide (with a button to copy the URL), and
- a quick command summary.

If the Help Window is already open, running `help` will focus the existing window.

Format: `help`

**Expected outcome:** The Help Window opens or comes to the front, displaying a link to the User Guide and a command summary.

#### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows all trainers and all clients.

This command resets both lists to show all entries by clearing any active `find` filters.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** To also clear a trainer selection made via the GUI, run `list-c` (without an index) after `list`.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** You can also click the status buttons at the top of the panels (labelled **Showing: Filtered**) in the GUI to immediately clear their active filters without having to type the `list` command.</div>

Format: `list`

**Expected outcome:** Both the trainers and clients lists are refreshed to show all entries, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Finding persons: `find`

Finds trainers and clients whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `hans` matches `Hans`.
* The order of keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` matches `Bo Hans`.
* Partial words are matched. e.g. `Han` matches `Hans`.
* **Valid characters**: Each keyword may only contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, apostrophes, and slashes. e.g. `Bob123`, `o'connor`, and `s/o` are valid; `Bob@` and `al.ha` are not.
* Results include persons matching **at least one** keyword (OR search).
* Run `list` to return to the full list after searching.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** You can also click the status button at the top of either list panel (labelled **Showing: Filtered**) in the GUI to quickly clear the filter for that panel.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** Use `find-t` to search exclusively for trainers, or `find-c` to search exclusively for clients.</div>

Examples:
* `find David` — returns `david`, `David Hasselhoff`, `David`.
* `find alex david` — returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`, `Alexander`.

![find](images/find.png)

**Expected outcome:** Both lists are filtered to show only persons whose names contain the given keywords. A message showing the number of persons listed is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes a trainer or client. Use the prefix `t/` for trainers or `c/` for clients.

Format: `delete t/TRAINER_INDEX` or `delete c/CLIENT_INDEX`

* `t/TRAINER_INDEX` refers to the index in the **trainer list**.
* `c/CLIENT_INDEX` refers to the index in the **client list**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** A trainer cannot be deleted if they still have active clients. Remove their clients first using `delete c/...`.</div>

Examples:
* `delete t/2` — deletes the 2nd trainer.
* `delete c/1` — deletes the 1st client.

**Expected outcome:** The specified person is permanently removed from the application, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Clearing all data: `clear`

Deletes all trainers and clients from GymOps.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** This action is irreversible. All data will be permanently deleted.</div>

After clearing, GymOps will immediately save the empty data set to disk.

**Expected outcome:** All trainers and clients are removed from the application, the UI panels are cleared, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Exporting data: `export`

Exports the current GymOps data to a JSON file at the specified location.

Format: `export FILE_PATH`

* `FILE_PATH` can be an absolute path (e.g., `C:/data/export.json` on Windows or `/Users/name/export.json` on macOS/Linux) or a relative path (e.g., `data/export.json` or `export.json`).
* If a relative path is provided, it is resolved relative to the folder where GymOps is executed.
* The file must have a `.json` extension. If the parent directory does not exist, it will be automatically created.

Examples:
* `export data/my_export.json` — exports the current data to a file named `my_export.json` inside the `data` folder.

**Expected outcome:** The current data is successfully exported to the specified file, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Importing data: `import`

Imports GymOps data from a specified JSON file, replacing the current application data.

Format: `import FILE_PATH`

* `FILE_PATH` works exactly the same as in the `export` command (both absolute and relative paths are supported).
* The file must have a `.json` extension.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** This action overwrites your existing data. Unsaved changes to the current session will be lost, and any data existing in the specified file will take their place.</div>

Examples:
* `import data/my_export.json` — imports the data from `my_export.json` into the application.

**Expected outcome:** The application's data is entirely replaced by the contents of the imported file. The UI refreshes to show the new data, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Exiting GymOps: `exit`

Exits the application.

GymOps saves automatically, so you do not need to run any additional command before exiting.

Format: `exit`

**Expected outcome:** The application window safely closes and the program terminates.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Saving data

GymOps saves data automatically after every command that modifies it. No manual saving is needed.

---

#### Do not edit the data file

Data is saved as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/GymOps.json`.
This file is **managed by GymOps** and is **not meant to be edited by hand**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:** Do **not** edit `GymOps.json` manually. This is **unsupported** and may corrupt your data (or violate data constraints), causing GymOps to drop records or start with an empty dataset. GymOps also auto-saves after successful commands, so any manual changes may be overwritten. Use `export`/`import` for backups and transfers. If you need to move data by copying files, replace the whole file only while GymOps is **closed**.</div>

---

### Trainer Management

These commands allow you to manage your roster of trainers, keeping their contact information up to date.

#### Adding a trainer: `add-t`

Adds a new trainer to GymOps.

Format: `add-t n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL`

Examples:
* `add-t n/NotDotManjan p/3298493 e/ndt@ndt.com`

![add trainer](images/addTrainer.png)
**Expected outcome:** The new trainer is added to the **Trainers** panel, and a success message is displayed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Adding a trainer resets all active filters on both lists and clears any trainer selection.</div>

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

### Client Management

These commands help you manage your clients, assign them to trainers, and update their personal details.

#### Adding a client: `add-c`

Adds a new client and assigns them to an existing trainer.

Format: `add-c n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER t/TRAINER_INDEX [v/VALIDITY]`

* `TRAINER_INDEX` must refer to a trainer visible in the **current trainer list**.
* `VALIDITY` is an optional field that must be a valid date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. e.g. `v/2028-09-09`. Using a wrong format such as `v/09-09-2028` will show: `Validity should be a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.`

* **Phone uniqueness**: `PHONE_NUMBER` must be strictly unique globally across both trainers and clients.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** The current date is accepted as a valid membership validity date. Only past dates are rejected.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** `TRAINER_INDEX` always refers to the index in the *current* trainer list. Run `list-t` first to view all trainers before assigning.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** Run `list-t` to confirm the correct trainer index before adding a client.</div>

Examples:
* `add-c n/Sid p/12390092 t/1` — adds Sid and assigns him to the 1st trainer in the list.
* `add-c n/Alice Lim p/81234567 t/1 v/2028-09-09` — adds Alice Lim, assigns her to the 1st trainer, and sets her membership validity to 2028-09-09.

![add client](images/addClient.png)
**Expected outcome:** The new client is assigned to the specified trainer, added to the **Clients** panel, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

* **Name length**: `NAME` must be no longer than 50 characters.
* **Phone uniqueness**: `PHONE_NUMBER` must be strictly unique globally across both trainers and clients.
* **Clearing Optional Fields**: You can completely wipe an existing optional property (Focus, Remark, or Validity) by providing its parameter prefix without any value (e.g., `f/`, `r/`, `v/`).
* When editing the trainer assignment, `TRAINER_INDEX` must refer to a valid trainer.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** `TRAINER_INDEX` always refers to the index in the *current* trainer list. Run `list-t` first to view all trainers before assigning.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** Run `list-c` to confirm the correct client index before editing.</div>

#### Reassigning a client: `reassign-c`

Reassigns an existing client to a different trainer. All client data (calorie target, intake, workout focus, remark) is preserved.

Format: `reassign-c CLIENT_INDEX t/TRAINER_INDEX`

* `CLIENT_INDEX` must refer to a client in the **client list**.
* `TRAINER_INDEX` must refer to a trainer visible in the **current trainer list**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** If either list is filtered, indexes refer to the filtered results. Run `list` first to reassign using the full lists.</div>

Examples:
* `reassign-c 5 t/2` — reassigns the 5th client to the 2nd trainer.

![reassign client](images/reassignClient.png)
**Expected outcome:** The client's assigned trainer is updated while preserving all other data. A success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Listing clients: `list-c`

Shows all clients in GymOps, or only clients assigned to a specific trainer.

Format: `list-c [TRAINER_INDEX]`

* If `TRAINER_INDEX` is omitted, shows all clients and clears any active trainer filter.
* If `TRAINER_INDEX` is provided, shows only clients assigned to the trainer at that index in the **current trainer list**.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Clicking on a trainer's card in the Graphical User Interface (GUI) applies a trainer filter to the currently displayed client list. Therefore, if you currently have an active search filter (e.g. `find-c`), clicking a trainer card does not clear that search; it further narrows the visible client list to matching clients assigned to that trainer. To view all clients assigned to the selected trainer, clear the client search first by running `list-c` or clicking **Showing: Filtered**.</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:bulb: **Tip:** After filtering clients by trainer (via the GUI or by using an index), run `list-c` without an index to return to the full client list.</div>

Examples:
* `list-c` — shows all clients.
* `list-c 1` — shows only clients assigned to the 1st trainer in the current list.

**Expected outcome:** The clients list is refreshed to show either all clients or the specified trainer's clients, and a success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Finding clients: `find-c`

Finds clients whose names contain any of the given keywords. Searches only the client list.

Format: `find-c KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* **Search Rules**: Follows the same search rules as [`find`](#finding-persons-find) (case-insensitive, partial match, OR search, keyword character restrictions).
* **Filtered Scope**: `find-c` restricts its search strictly to the *currently visible* client list. To search all clients, reset the list first using `list`.
* **Clear via CLI**: Run `list-c` to return to the previously unfiltered client list after your search is done.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** You can also click the status button at the top of the client list panel (labelled **Showing: Filtered**) in the GUI to quickly clear the search filter.</div>

Examples:
* `find-c Alice` — returns all clients with "Alice" in their name.
* `find-c Alice Bob` — returns all clients with "Alice" or "Bob" in their name.

**Expected outcome:** The clients list is filtered to show only clients whose names contain the given keywords. A message showing the number of clients listed is displayed.

### Health Tracking

These commands provide targeted features to monitor and encourage your clients' fitness progression, dietary goals, and membership status.

#### Setting a calorie target: `set-cal`

Sets the daily calorie target for a client.

Format: `set-cal c/CLIENT_INDEX cal/CALORIE_TARGET`

* `CLIENT_INDEX` must refer to a client in the **client list**.
* `CALORIE_TARGET` must be a non-negative integer. Use `0` to clear the calorie target.

Examples:
* `set-cal c/1 cal/3000` — sets a 3000-calorie daily target for the 1st client.
* `set-cal c/1 cal/0` — clears the calorie target for the 1st client.

![set calorie](images/setCalorieTarget.png)

**Expected outcome:** The client's calorie target is updated and displayed on their card. A success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Logging calorie intake: `log-cal`

Logs calorie intake for a client. The input overwrites the client's existing daily intake total.

Format: `log-cal c/CLIENT_INDEX cal/CALORIES`

* `CLIENT_INDEX` must refer to a client in the **client list**.
* `CALORIES` must be a non-negative integer. Use `0` to reset the client's intake total.

Examples:
* `log-cal c/1 cal/1500` — sets the 1st client's daily intake total to 1500 calories.
* `log-cal c/1 cal/0` — resets the 1st client's daily intake total to 0.

![log calorie](images/logCalorie.png)

**Expected outcome:** The client's calorie intake total is updated. A success message is displayed.

If the client has a calorie target set, their card will also show their intake progress.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Daily intake does not reset automatically at midnight. You must manually reset it using `log-cal c/INDEX cal/0` whenever a new tracking cycle starts.</div>

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Setting a workout focus: `set-focus`

Sets the primary workout focus for a client. Overwrites any existing focus.

Format: `set-focus c/CLIENT_INDEX f/FOCUS`

* `CLIENT_INDEX` must refer to a client in the **client list**.
* `FOCUS` must contain only letters (A–Z or a–z), and words may be separated by single spaces. e.g. `Upper Body` is valid.
* **Clearing Focus**: To completely wipe a client's workout focus, leave the `set-focus` command behind and use `edit-c INDEX f/` instead.

Examples:
* `set-focus c/1 f/Legs and Glutes` — sets the 1st client's workout focus to "Legs and Glutes".

![set focus](images/setFocus.png)
**Expected outcome:** The client's workout focus is updated and displayed as a tag on their card. A success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Adding a remark: `remark`

Adds a remark to a client (e.g., to track injuries, record physical constraints, or note personal milestones). Overwrites any existing remark.

Format: `remark c/CLIENT_INDEX r/REMARK`

* `CLIENT_INDEX` must refer to a client in the **client list**.
* `REMARK` must not be empty.
* Remark is a client-specific functionality. It enables trainers to keep track of specific concerns/notes pertaining to a particular client.

Examples:
* `remark c/1 r/Recovering from ACL Team` — sets the 1st client's remark to "Recovering from ACL Tear".

![remark](images/remark.png)
**Expected outcome:** The client's remark is updated and displayed on their card. A success message is displayed.

[⬆ Back to top](#top)

---

#### Setting a membership validity: `set-validity`

Sets the membership validity date for a client. Overwrites any existing validity.

Format: `set-validity INDEX v/VALIDITY`

* `INDEX` must refer to a client in the **client list**.
* `VALIDITY` must be a valid date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`. e.g. `v/2028-09-09`. Using a wrong format such as `v/09-09-2028` will show: `Validity should be a valid date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.`
* GymOps currently displays the validity date but does not automatically enforce expiry or visually highlight expired memberships.
* **Clearing Validity**: To completely remove an existing validity date, leave the `set-validity` command behind and use `edit-c INDEX v/` instead.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** The current date is accepted as a valid membership validity date. Only past dates are rejected.</div>


Examples:
* `set-validity 1 v/2026-12-31` — sets the 1st client's membership validity to 31 Dec 2026.

![set validity](images/setValidity.png)

**Expected outcome:** The client's membership validity is updated and displayed on their card. A success message is displayed.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my data to another computer?**

Use `export` on the old computer and `import` on the new computer (recommended).

If you prefer copying files directly, install GymOps on the other computer and replace the empty data file it creates with your existing `[JAR file location]/data/GymOps.json` **while GymOps is closed**. Do not edit the contents of the file.

---

**Q: I opened `GymOps.json` and saw a `tags` section. Can I edit it?**

GymOps may contain fields in the data file that are **not exposed through the app’s UI/CLI** (e.g., legacy/internal fields such as `tags`).

No. Do **not** edit the data file contents. Manual edits are **unsupported** and a small mistake can prevent GymOps from loading your data (or cause it to load with missing data).

If your goal is to label or categorise people, use the supported in-app commands instead. If you are trying to move/backup data, use `export`/`import` (recommended) or replace the entire file while GymOps is closed.

**Q: Why can't I delete a trainer?**

A trainer cannot be deleted if they still have active clients. Use `delete c/` to remove all of the trainer's clients first, then delete the trainer.

---

**Q: How do I delete a trainer who is far down the list?**

Use a `find` command to filter the trainer list, then delete using the filtered index.

Example:
1. Run `find-t NAME` (or `find NAME`) to narrow down the trainer list.
1. Confirm the trainer’s index in the filtered **Trainers** list.
1. Run `delete t/TRAINER_INDEX` (e.g., `delete t/1`).

If you need to return to the full trainer list, run `list-t`.

**Q: Can I undo a command?**

GymOps does not currently support an undo command. Before running destructive commands like `clear` or `delete`, consider running `export` first to back up your data.

---

**Q: Why does my client list remain empty even after I run `list-c 1`?**

If you previously ran a search such as `find-c`, that search filter remains active. Running `list-c 1` or clicking a trainer card filters the currently displayed client list, so the result may still be incomplete or even empty.

To view all clients assigned to that trainer, clear the client filter first by clicking the **Showing: Filtered** button in the GUI or by running `list-c`.

---

**Q: Why does my calorie intake not reset to zero each day?**

GymOps does not automatically reset daily calorie intake.

To correct a client's displayed intake total, use `log-cal` with the desired total.

To reset a client's intake total to 0, run `log-cal c/CLIENT_INDEX cal/0`.

## Known Issues

1. **Multiple screens:** If you move the app to a secondary screen and later use only the primary screen, the GUI may open off-screen. Fix: delete `preferences.json` (found in the same folder as the `.jar` file) before restarting the app.
2. **Minimised Help Window:** Running `help` again while the Help Window is minimised will not open a new window. Fix: manually restore the minimised window.
3. **Double-clicking the JAR:** On some systems, double-clicking the `.jar` may not start the app. Fix: run using `java -jar YOUR_FILE_NAME.jar` from a terminal.
4. **Write-protected folders:** If GymOps is placed in a write-protected folder, it may fail to save changes. Fix: move the `.jar` to a writable folder (e.g., your user directory) and run it from there.
5. **macOS fullscreen dialogs:** macOS users running secondary dialogs (e.g., Help Window) in fullscreen may encounter unexpected window behaviour. Fix: exit fullscreen for the main app window before opening dialogs.
